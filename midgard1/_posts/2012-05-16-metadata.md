## Datetimes

Every ISO 8601 formatted date is stored in UTC timezone. Timezone qualifier is defined in datetime string, however it may be ignored by some database engines. (MySQL for example ignores timezone qualifier but stores datetime in UTC). 

When object's record  is retrieved from database , datetime is not converted to local timezone. And datetime string is retrieved "as is".

Client application is responsible to convert datetime to local timezone. Or to convert datetime to any other format if needed. When property value ( with `MGD_TYPE_TMESTAMP` type) is incorrectly set or converted to ISO 8601 datetime format, then  database storage engine converts such value to default unset datetime: __0000-00-00 00:00__.

An empty string is set as property value if datetime is not set for property which holds `MGD_TYPE_TIMESTAMP` value type. Such value is easy accessible with simple 'if' condition:

    <?php
    if ($object->metadata->schedulestart)
    {
        echo "Published since $object->metadata->schedulestart";
    }
    ?>

### Datetimes in MidCOM

The [MidCOM](/midcom/) DBA system modifies datetime handling so that all metadata datetime properties can be used as Unix timestamps instead of strings.

    <?php
    // Set the article's publication time to NOW
    $article->metadata->published = time();
    $article->update();

    // Echo article's approval time
    $approval = strftime('%x %X', $article->metadata->approved);
    echo "Article was approved on {$approval}.";
    ?>

## Example

    <?php
    $guid = "f6b665f1984503790ed91f39b11b5392";

    $parameter = new midgard_parameter();
    
    if($parameter->get_by_guid($guid)) 
    {
    
        echo "Parameter with $parameter->guid was 
             created: $parameter->metadata->created"; 
    }
    ?> 


*Note:** to query object with metadata properties use MidgardQueryBuilder with metadata.propertyname as constraint. The same syntax is used when ordering by metadata property is needed
