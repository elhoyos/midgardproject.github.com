MidCOM releases are shipped as PEAR packages for better version management and control. The packages utilize a MidCOM-specific channel in [ragnaroek.pear.midgard-project.org](http://ragnaroek.pear.midgard-project.org/).

The [Datagard tool in Midgard1](/midgard1/#datagard) performs all required steps to initialize all channels (Ragnaroek, HTMLPurifier, etc) and install all initial base packages. If you are only interested in installing PEAR packages, run datagard with desired action type:

    # datagard -a pear

Keep in mind, that PEAR action removes old MidCOM if found, and install new packages from new channel.

### Useful information:

*   **Channel URL:** ragnaroek.pear.midgard-project.org
*   **Channel alias:** ragnaroek

If, for some reason, some package is not installed or it's not included in base packages, install it manually:

    # datagard -a pear -p package_name

When a package is installed via Datagard, the tool will take care of all the necessary actions like updating Midgard database tables.
