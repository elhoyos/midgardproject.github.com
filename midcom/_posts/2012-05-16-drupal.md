This instruction supposes that you are installing MidCOM website in a subdomain of Drupal website and that MidCOM has access to Drupal's host filesystem and database. For example: Drupal at *example.com* and MidCOM at *midcom.example.com*. It is possible to achieve similar results in other environments, but process would become a bit more complicated

Drupal side
-----------
1. install "**erl**" (External Redirector after Login) module available from [github repo](http://github.com/nemein/MeeGo/tree/master/drupal/modules/)
2. enable "**erl**" module from Drupal's administration UI. It will register **erl/login**, **erl/logout** and **erl/return** URLs
3. in "**erl**" module's settings add MidCOM's hostname to the list of allowed domains.

MidCOM side
-------------

0. make sure, that php's **pdo_mysql** extension is enabled (or **pdo_pgsql**, if Drupal uses PostgreSQL database)
1. install "**net.nemein.drupalauth**" component from [midgard's svn repo](https://svn.midgard-project.org/midgard/branches/ragnaroek/midcom/net.nemein.drupalauth/) (8.09.8.25504+)
2. make sure, that **midcom.core**'s version is 8.09.8.25505 or newer (update if necessary)
3. in MidCOM's website-settings (available via Asgard) set 3 config-variables:
 * Path to Drupal's settings.php file => "/usr/share/drupal6/sites/default/settings.php" (set whatever is right for your setup)
 * Drupal's domain => "example.com" (according to our imaginary setup, set real domain of your Drupal host)
 * Enable authentication via Drupal => "Yes"

Done.
As soon as you press "Save" button MidCOM won't allow you to authenticate using midgard logins/passwords anymore. You will need to use Drupal's credentials.
> Hint: create "admin" account in Drupal. It will connect to midgard's "admin" account and you will be able to proceed with this instruction

Edit your MidCOM styles to have the following links:
----------------------------------------------------

1. http://example.com/?q=erl/login for "Login" link (remember to replace "example.com" with your Drupal's site hostname)
2. http://example.com/?q=erl/logout for "Logout" link
3. http://example.com/?q=user/register for "Register" link
4. http://example.com/?q=user for "My Account" link
