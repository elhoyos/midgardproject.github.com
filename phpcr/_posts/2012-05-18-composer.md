You need to have a [midgard2 PHP extension](https://github.com/midgardproject/midgard-php5) installed. On many distributions setting this up is as simple as:

    $ sudo apt-get install php5-midgard2

If your distribution doesn't come with Midgard2, then you can either compile it manually or use [our precompiled packages](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/midgardproject:/ratatoskr/).

Then set your project to depend on `midgard/phpcr` by having your `composer.json` to include:

    "require": {
        "midgard/phpcr": ">=1.0"
    }

Then just install the provider via [Composer](http://packagist.org/):

    $ wget http://getcomposer.org/composer.phar
    $ php composer.phar install

You also need to copy the Midgard2 PHPCR schemas from `vendor/midgard/phpcr/data/share` to your schema directory (by default `/usr/share/midgard2`):

    $ sudo cp vendor/midgard/phpcr/data/share/schema/* /usr/share/midgard2/schema/
    $ sudo cp vendor/midgard/phpcr/data/share/views/* /usr/share/midgard2/views/
