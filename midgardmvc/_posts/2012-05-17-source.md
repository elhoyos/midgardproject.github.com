The easiest way to install Midgard MVC is by using the midgardmvc_installer tool. You can install the tool with PEAR by running the following:

    $ sudo pear channel-discover pear.indeyets.pp.ru
    $ sudo pear install indeyets/midgardmvc_installer

After this you can install Midgard MVC applications by pointing the Midgard MVC installer to a application configuration YAML file and a target directory. For example:

    $ midgardmvc install https://github.com/bergie/org_midgardproject_productsite/raw/master/rdf.yml ~/midgardexample

The Midgard MVC installer will install Midgard MVC, and all components and libraries required by the application. It will also generate a Midgard2 database for the application. Now running the application is easy:

    $ ~/midgardexample/run

By default the [AppServer in PHP](https://github.com/indeyets/appserver-in-php/wiki) used for running Midgard MVC will be available in&#xA0;[http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001/).
