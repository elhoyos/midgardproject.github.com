Content Repository is a service that sits between an application and a data store. It provides several advantages:

*   **Common rules for data access** mean that multiple applications can work with same content without breaking consistency of the data
*   **Signals about changes** let applications know when another application using the repository modifies something, enabling collaborative data management between apps
*   **Objects instead of SQL** mean that developers can deal with data using APIs more compatible with the rest of their desktop programming environment, and without having to fear issues like SQL injection
*   **Data model is scriptable** when you use a content repository, meaning that users can easily write Python or PHP scripts to perform batch operations on their data without having to learn your storage format
*   **Synchronization and sharing** features can be implemented on the content repository level meaning that you gain these features without having to worry about them

The basic idea is that with a Content Repository, developers can use standard interfaces for data storage instead of coming up with their own file formats or database schemas.
